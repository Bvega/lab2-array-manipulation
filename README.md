# Lab 2 â€“ Array Manipulation

This web project was built for Module 4 Lab 2 to practice array manipulation in JavaScript. 
It focuses on creating a dynamic shopping list that interacts with user input.

## Features
- Add new items to a shopping list
- Prevent duplicates
- Remove the last item added
- Filter the list in code (for search purposes)
- Render the list dynamically in the browser

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter an item in the input box.
3. Click **Add Item** to include it in the list.
4. Click **Remove Last Item** to delete the most recent item.
5. The displayed list updates automatically.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. How did array methods like `push()` and `filter()` help me manipulate data in this activity?

**Answer:**  
The `push()` method helped me add items to the list easily. The `filter()` method allowed me to find matching items, which is useful for search features or duplicate checking.

### 2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?

**Answer:**  
A key challenge was ensuring the search and comparison were case-insensitive. I resolved this by converting strings to lowercase before comparing.

### 3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?

**Answer:**  
To make it better, I would add a live search field so users can filter the list interactively. I'd also include messages to give feedback when adding duplicates or submitting empty inputs.
